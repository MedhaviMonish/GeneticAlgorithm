Different  implementations of GA using java and python

Genetic algorithm is inspired byCharles Darwin's theory of natural evolution.
We create a large population of the solution and assign them score on the basis 
of how good (fit) they are. Then we cross (merge) them hoping to get a better solution.
The number of total population depends on how much complicated the problem is.
After scoring them we assign probability of being a parent to each so that population with higher score 
gets more probability to merge with other fit parent and this process may result in a better population.
You can also add different mutation rate so the offspring will change randomly which might help
in exploring the problem.

Sometimes this may not properly then you will need to restart the algorithm again.
You might end up with an optimal solution or sub-optimal solution.
